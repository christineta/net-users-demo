### Exercise 8.1: OpenAPI/Swagger Enhancement

**Goal**: Create comprehensive API documentation

**Sample Prompt**:
```
Enhance the OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for the API.
Add XML documentation comments to all controllers and models.
Configure Swagger UI with API description, version, contact info, license.
Add example requests and responses to endpoints.
Document all possible status codes for each endpoint.
Add authentication/authorization documentation to Swagger.
Organize endpoints with tags. Add operation IDs for client generation.
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] XML documentation enabled in project
- [ ] All public APIs have XML comments
- [ ] Swagger UI shows comprehensive docs
- [ ] Example requests/responses included
- [ ] Status codes documented
- [ ] Authentication documented in Swagger

**Stretch Goals**:
- Generate client SDKs (TypeScript, C#, Python)
- Add request/response schemas
- Implement API versioning in OpenAPI
- Add OpenAPI validation in tests
- Create Postman collection from OpenAPI
- Add API changelog documentation
- Implement contract testing

**Sample Prompt for Client Generation**:
```
Use NSwag or Swashbuckle to generate a TypeScript client SDK from OpenAPI spec.
Configure client generation in the build process. Generate models and API client.
Add a sample TypeScript project that demonstrates using the generated client.
Include error handling, retry logic, and type safety in the client.
```

- API endpoints documentation
- Development setup instructions
- Testing strategy and how to run tests
- Deployment guide
- Contributing guidelines
- Troubleshooting section
- License and contact information
Use Markdown formatting effectively with code blocks, tables, and links.
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] README covers all essential sections
- [ ] Clear step-by-step quick start
- [ ] Architecture diagram included
- [ ] Code examples are accurate
- [ ] Links to additional resources
- [ ] Properly formatted Markdown

**Stretch Goals**:

### Exercise 8.3: Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

**Goal**: Document important architectural decisions

**Sample Prompt**:
```
Create an ADR (Architecture Decision Record) system for the project.
Create docs/adr directory. Add template file: 0000-adr-template.md.
Create first ADR: "0001-use-in-memory-storage.md" documenting why
we use static list instead of database for this demo project.
Create second ADR: "0002-rest-api-design.md" documenting API design choices.
Follow the format: Title, Status, Context, Decision, Consequences.
Add index file listing all ADRs.
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] ADR directory structure created
- [ ] Template file created
- [ ] At least 2 ADRs written
- [ ] ADRs follow consistent format
- [ ] ADR index file maintained
- [ ] ADRs linked from main README

**Stretch Goals**:
- Add ADRs for: authentication choice, logging framework, test strategy
- Create ADR status workflow (proposed, accepted, deprecated, superseded)
- Link ADRs to related code sections
- Add decision review dates
- Create ADR visualization/timeline
- Implement ADR CLI tool

### Exercise 8.4: Contributing Guide

**Goal**: Make it easy for others to contribute

**Sample Prompt**:
```
Create a CONTRIBUTING.md file with guidelines for contributing to the project.
Include sections for: code of conduct, how to report bugs, how to request features,
development workflow (branch naming, commit messages, PR process),
code style guidelines, testing requirements, documentation requirements.
Add a pull request template. Add issue templates for bug reports and features.
Include a checklist for PR reviews.
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md created
- [ ] Clear contribution workflow documented
- [ ] Code style guidelines specified
- [ ] PR template created in .github folder
- [ ] Issue templates created
- [ ] Review checklist included

**Stretch Goals**:

- Add first-timers-only issues
- Implement CLA (Contributor License Agreement)
- Add release notes guidelines
- Create mentorship program docs
- Add documentation contribution guide
