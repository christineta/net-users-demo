## Overview

This module focuses on completing and enhancing the basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the Users API. You'll implement the missing DELETE endpoint, add advanced features like partial updates and pagination, and learn how to design robust REST APIs.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Complete CRUD operations with proper HTTP semantics
- Implement pagination and filtering for list endpoints
- Handle bulk operations efficiently
- Follow REST API best practices

**Prerequisites:**
- Basic understanding of REST APIs
- Familiarity with ASP.NET Core controllers
- Understanding of HTTP status codes

## Exercises

### Exercise 1.1: Implement Delete User Endpoint

**Goal**: Complete the missing DELETE endpoint (marked as TODO in the project)

**Sample Prompt**:
```
Create a DELETE endpoint at /api/v1/users/{id} in UsersController. 
Return 204 No Content on success, 404 Not Found if the user doesn't exist. 
Follow the existing pattern in the controller. Add logging for the operation.
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Endpoint responds to DELETE requests at `/api/v1/users/{id}`
- [ ] Returns 204 status code when user is successfully deleted
- [ ] Returns 404 status code when user ID doesn't exist
- [ ] Logs the deletion operation with appropriate level
- [ ] Includes XML documentation comments

**Stretch Goals**:
- Implement soft delete with `DeletedAt` timestamp property
- Add ability to restore soft-deleted users
- Create unit tests for the delete operation

**Sample Prompt for Stretch**:
```
Refactor the delete endpoint to implement soft delete pattern. 
Add a DeletedAt nullable DateTime property to UserProfile. 
When deleting, set the timestamp instead of removing from the list. 
Update GetUsers to filter out soft-deleted users by default.
Add a query parameter includeDeleted=true to show all users.
```

### Exercise 1.2: Implement Partial Update (PATCH)

**Goal**: Add a PATCH endpoint for partial user updates

**Sample Prompt**:
```
Add a PATCH endpoint at /api/v1/users/{id} in UsersController. 
Accept a JSON object with optional fields: FullName and Emoji (but not Id). 
Only update fields that are provided in the request. 
Return 200 with updated user, 404 if not found, 400 for invalid data.
Use Microsoft.AspNetCore.JsonPatch if needed.
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Endpoint responds to PATCH requests at `/api/v1/users/{id}`
- [ ] Updates only the fields provided in the request body
- [ ] Prevents modification of the `Id` field
- [ ] Returns appropriate status codes (200, 404, 400)
- [ ] Validates input data

**Stretch Goals**:
- Implement JSON Merge Patch (RFC 7396) vs JSON Patch (RFC 6902)
- Add optimistic concurrency control with ETag headers
- Support for undoing specific field updates

### Exercise 1.3: Add Pagination and Filtering

**Goal**: Enhance GET /users endpoint with pagination and filtering capabilities

**Sample Prompt**:
```
Enhance the GetUsers endpoint to support pagination and filtering.
Add query parameters: page (default 1), pageSize (default 10, max 100), 
sortBy (id/fullName/emoji), sortOrder (asc/desc).
Return results with pagination metadata: totalCount, currentPage, pageSize, totalPages.
Add a filter parameter: searchTerm to search in FullName.
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Supports `page` and `pageSize` query parameters
- [ ] Supports `sortBy` and `sortOrder` parameters
- [ ] Returns pagination metadata in response headers or wrapped response
- [ ] Implements search filtering on FullName
- [ ] Validates page size limits (max 100)

**Stretch Goals**:
- Implement cursor-based pagination for better performance
- Add multiple filter parameters (emoji, id prefix)
- Support for complex filter expressions
- Add ETag support for caching
- Return `Link` headers for next/prev pages (RFC 5988)

**Sample Prompt for Cursor Pagination**:
```
Refactor pagination to use cursor-based approach instead of page numbers.
Add a cursor parameter (base64 encoded). Return a nextCursor in the response
that clients can use for the next page. Cursor should encode the last item's Id.
```

### Exercise 1.4: Retrieve User by Email

**Goal**: Add endpoint to find users by email address

**Sample Prompt**:
```
Add a GET endpoint at /api/v1/users/by-email to UsersController.
Accept an email query parameter and return the matching user.
Return 404 if no user found. This teaches lookup by unique field.
First, add an Email property to UserProfile model.
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] `Email` property added to `UserProfile` model
- [ ] Endpoint responds to GET at `/api/v1/users/by-email?email=...`
- [ ] Returns 200 with user object when found
- [ ] Returns 404 when email doesn't match any user
- [ ] Email is validated for proper format

**Stretch Goals**:
- Support partial/fuzzy email search
- Case-insensitive email matching
- Return multiple users if email domain matches
- Add email uniqueness validation on create/update

---

### Exercise 1.5: Bulk Create Users

**Goal**: Add endpoint to create multiple users in one request

**Sample Prompt**:
```
Create a POST endpoint at /api/v1/users/bulk in UsersController.
Accept an array of UserProfile objects. Validate each one.
If all are valid, create them all and return 201 with the created users.
If any validation fails, return 400 with detailed error information.
Log how many users were created in the bulk operation.
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Endpoint accepts array of user objects
- [ ] All users created successfully or none (atomic operation)
- [ ] Returns 201 with array of created users
- [ ] Returns 400 with per-item validation errors
- [ ] Validates uniqueness of IDs across the batch

**Stretch Goals**:
- Support partial success mode with per-item status
- Add transaction simulation for rollback scenarios
- Implement batch size limits (e.g., max 100 per request)
- Add progress reporting for large batches
